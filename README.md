# Spring-Boot-Todo-Frontend

This is the frontend for a very basic todo app. I built this application to begin familiarizing myself with JWT auth and Spring Security, in addition to simply getting more practice with Spring Boot. As far as the frontend it has served as an opportunity to use some things I haven't used much before such as React Hooks, [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) library for form validations, and [styled-components] (https://styled-components.com/) (mixed with React-Bootstrap).
